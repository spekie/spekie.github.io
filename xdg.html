      <h1><a href="/">Criticism of freedesktop.org (and Red Hat)</a></h1>
      <p>In recent news, freedesktop.org was under fire for deleting a fork of the X11 project and a developer who contributed to the X11 project who himself created that fork. They tried to completely delete all traces of the developer, and the fact that he was even a contributor by removing him from their personally hosted GitLab instance. I see this as an act of pure aggression or provocation from the freedesktop.org project and ultimately an unfortunate turn of events and an exposure of Linux desktop being revealed as being controlled by large corporate interests like Red Hat. I am typing this here because the majority of projects on the freedesktop.org GitLab instance have contributors from Red Hat and they all have quite a large amount of control in the direction of the projects, it is not as bad as Google having completely control of AOSP and the rest of their open source projects, however it is still pretty bad because this is still a large corporation.</p>
      <h2>Red Hat?</h2>
      <p>Also apparently people think systemd is bad because of Red Hat? This is a pure myth, it is not directly controlled by them it is made by a famous software developer in the Linux world who has some links to Red Hat or I guess connections, but it is literally his own personal projects hosted on his own <a href="https://github.com/systemd/systemd">GitHub</a> organisation, so that point is completely irrelevant and so is Red Hat spying on you, thought it could be possible. I personally do not think Red Hat is spying on you, they are not like Google (for now) but who knows? I do not particularly trust them and I will not trust proprietary software. Some people might argue that Red Hat is truly trying to spy on people because they are trying to force people to move into the new Wayland protocol instead of the good old X11. A lot of Linux distributions have started to move into Wayland, I do not particularly know if it has anything to do with that fork and that developer being banned from the freedesktop.org GitLab instance, nor do I particularly care about distributions moving into Wayland. However another instance of Red Hat, in a similar situation is when the developer of a new and trendy good looking Wayland compositor was banned from their GitLab instance, known as Vaxry or something. The developer is honestly childish, and does show some completely immature behaviour, however an outright ban over something foolish like not properly managing his project's Discord server is something else... And also yes, I am talking about the <a href="https://github.com/hyprwm">Hyprland</a> project. We also lost some really good work done by the developer, because his contributions were actual real contributions that helped the development of the Wayland ecosystem like the <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_Desktop_Portal">XDG Desktop Portals</a>.</p>
      <h2>X12</h2>
      <p>Basically there is a new X11 in our world, sadly it was not named X12 but instead named XLibre. The fork of the developer who was banned from the freedesktop.org GitLab instance now hosts his new personal fork of the X11 project on <a href="https://github.com/X11Libre/xserver">GitHub</a> under the name of XLibre. So far development is fairly new, has quite a bit of stars so maybe more people will start to contribute. The only contributions made so far, are just overall cleanups like removing the XWayland layer and some minor rebranding. I did not really like the weird political messages displayed on the 'README.md' file as it referenced a certain current president's saying, I will not go any further as to explain or elaborate.</p>
      <h2>Alternatives</h2>
      <p>The only alternative I can think of, that will save you from all of this politically motivated and weird people is OpenBSD and maybe a few other BSD derivatives. Let me take OpenBSD as an example, it has a version of X11 that is slightly modified for OpenBSD in terms of security and renamed to <a href="https://www.xenocara.org/">Xenocara</a>. It is very well still the old X server and not a fork as stated in the website.</p>
